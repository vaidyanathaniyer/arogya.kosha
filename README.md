Arogya Kosha is born from a simple, yet powerful vision: to give people complete control of their health records — allowing them to organize and access them effortlessly, anytime, anywhere.

Inspired by India’s rich medical heritage, I designed Arogya Kosha as a personal digital health repository. Arogya (health) and Kosha (repository) blend ancient wisdom with modern technology. This project is my step towards solving today’s challenges in healthcare data management.

Healthcare is personal, and Arogya Kosha aims to make it simpler, more secure, and always within your control. Managing health records shouldn’t be complicated. Arogya Kosha strips away barriers to create a seamless experience. Whether you're at home or on the go, your health information will always be at your fingertips.

While Arogya Kosha is rooted in India’s healthcare tradition, it’s designed to address global challenges. What starts as a humble tool has the potential to evolve, incorporating features like multi-user support, cloud integration, and advanced health analytics. This is just the beginning, but the foundation is strong.

It’s open-source because I believe in the power of collaboration. With contributions from developers, researchers, and healthcare professionals, Arogya Kosha can grow and solve bigger problems.

Arogya Kosha is more than just code — it’s about giving people the tools to take control of their health journey, transparently, simply, and securely.

Let's build the future of health data management — starting today.
